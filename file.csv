Over 50 years later, the Clearwater remains an interactive environmental classroom—or, in its builder’s words, “a carnival, museum, and showboat all wrapped into one.” Featuring rare interviews with Seeger himself, Down by the Riverside is a beautiful, stirring tribute to the communities of people who continue to restore and preserve this elegant symbol of the Hudson Valley.

The second is ""God is I"" or ""Bhagwan is shining as I"" or ""I am Brahman"" They both lead to attention on the self, but the feeling is subtly different.
